This is a simple proof of concept project to attempt to depersonalize
Google searches by aggregating personalized results.  

1. Fred, Mary and John have the weoogle Chrome extension installed and
all three of them are connected to the weoogle service via WebSocket.

2. Fred searches for "Egypt" on Google.  The weoogle extension catches
this and forwards the request to the weoogle service.

3. The weoogle services broadcasts the search request for "Egypt".

4. Mary and John peform searches for "Egypt" in the background and
forward anonymized (TODO) results back to the weoogle service.

5. The weoogle services returns the aggregated results to Fred.

6. Fred's weoogle Chrome extension integrates the aggregated results
into the Google search DOM. (TODO)
